    <p> My main aim in RS School is to get as much experience in front-end development as possible. 
        On the 1-th year of studying in Economic University I found programming very interesting. 
        Much more interesting, than economics! So I started exploring this sphere and decided, that 
        RS School would be a great helper for me in achieving my goals. In future I'm going to become 
        a true and serious web-developer, who is always in trend and knows all the innovations in the 
        world of web-development.
