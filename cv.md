1. My main aim in RS School is to get as much experience in front-end development as possible. On the 1-th year of studying in Economic University I found programming very interesting. Much more interesting, than economics! So I started exploring this sphere and decided, that RS School would be a great helper for me in achieving my goals. In future I'm going to become a true and serious web-developer, who is always in trend and knows all the innovations in the world of web-development.
